# Spam Email Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham). The model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and trained on a dataset of labeled emails.

## Overview

Spam emails, also known as junk emails, are unsolicited messages sent in bulk to email addresses, often for commercial purposes or containing malicious content. Spam filters are essential tools for email providers and users to identify and block spam emails.

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient spam email classification model using machine learning techniques. The model can be integrated into email services or applications to automatically filter out spam emails and improve user experience.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Text data preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop words removal, and TF-IDF vectorization are applied to convert raw email text into numerical features.
- Model Training: The machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machine, or neural network) is trained on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
- Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in classifying spam emails.
- Deployment: The model can be deployed as a web service or integrated into email clients to provide real-time spam detection functionality.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of labeled emails, where each email is tagged as spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset may include metadata such as sender information, subject, and body of the email.
